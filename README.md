##Utilizing quantatative analysis techniques with Python and Pandas, a portfolio performance test was ran across multiple areas: volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios. Using jupyter lab as an analysis notebook, different "whale" portfolios were compared. Using this analysis, we can create a custom portfolio of stocks and compare to the S&P 500 index. 

##Using Pandas, a CSV file was read in as a DataFrame.Data was cleaned. Dates were converted to a "DateTimeIndex." Null values were removed. Data types were converted as needed. S&P500 closing prices were converted to daily returns. 'Whale Returns','Algorithmic Returns', and S&P500 Returns' were converted into a single DataFrame with columns for each portfolio's returns. 

##Daily Returns of all portfolios were calculated and plotted. Cumulative returns of all portfolios were calculated and plotted. A risk analysis was done to calculate standard deviation for each portfolio, and determine which portfolios are riskier than the S&P500. Annualized standard deviation was calculated.The rolling standard deviation was calculated and plotted for all portfolios using a 21-day window. The correlation between each stock to determine which portfolios may mimick the S&P500. The 60-day rolling beta was calculated between the 'whale portfolio' and the S&P500. Sharpe ratios were then calculated and plotted into a bar plot graph.
